## ‚ÑπÔ∏è General info

The world machine (or TWM for short) is a open source discord bot written in typescript using the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library.<br>
My motivation behind it was that all the other music bots I used didn't really suit me, so I decided to write my own!

## ‚≠ê Features
- üéµ [A very advanced music player]('fixme')
- üåü [A starboard script]('fixme')
- üëÄ [Multiple fun-to-use commands](https://github.com/Reishimanfr/TWM-bot/wiki/Commands)
