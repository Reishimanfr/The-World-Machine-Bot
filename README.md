## ‚ÑπÔ∏è General info

The world machine (or TWM for short) is an open-source discord bot written in typescript using the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library.<br>
My motivation was that all the other music bots I used didn't suit me, so I wrote my own!

## ‚≠ê Features
- YouTube, Spotify, and Soundcloud playback support
- [Sponsorblock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) integration
- Lots of QoL features to make the experience as nice as possible
- Amazing support from the bot's developer
- Very customizable starboard
- Docker support to easily host your instance in seconds
- A lot of other fun-to-use commands

## Want to self-host your own instance?

Check [this page](https://github.com/Reishimanfr/The-World-Machine-Bot/wiki/Self%E2%80%90hosting) for a step-by-step tutorial on how to host the bot (along with a [video tutorial!]())

botToken: ''

# Sets which type of database the bot should use. If you have a postgres database setup, it's recommended
# to use it as it's faster than sqlite. If you don't want to set up a postgres database you can just set this
# to "sqlite" and call it a day. The performance difference won't matter much for smaller bots.
# Allowed values: "postgres" | "sqlite"
database: postgres

# Available options: trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal
# Trace is the most verbose, and fatal is the least.
# Recommended level is info, unless you want to report a bug,

# Note 3: Stderr will always be piped on the "error" level
pipeLavalinkStdout: true
